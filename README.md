# Advanced_Robotic_2022

In this repository we keep the workshop sessions material for week5-week8 of the Advanced Robotics module. The corresponding folder for each week contains the google colab notebooks and other required resources for interactive and useful workshop sessions.

**Week5**
In this week we will get some hands on skills for implementing basic and useful feature for Probabilistic Movement Primitives (ProMP). ProMP is a probabilistic approach in the context of Learning from Demonstrations (LfD) which proposes a useful representation for robot trajectory either in joint or task space. For a more in depth understanding of ProMPs you can go through the folllowing papers:

Paraschos, Alexandros, Christian Daniel, Jan R. Peters, and Gerhard Neumann. "Probabilistic movement primitives." Advances in neural information processing systems 26 (2013)

Paraschos, Alexandros, Christian Daniel, Jan Peters, and Gerhard Neumann. "Using probabilistic movement primitives in robotics." Autonomous Robots 42, no. 3 (2018): 529-551.

To start working with the notebook after opening it in your github click on "Open in Colab" bottom on the top of the notebook and there you should be able to run the code cells and complete the workshop session assignments.
