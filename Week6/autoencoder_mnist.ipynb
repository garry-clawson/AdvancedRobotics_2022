        "## **Introduction**\n",
        "\n",
        "In this workshop, we are going to train a very basic autoencoder. An autoencoder is an unsupervised machine learning technique where you train the model on input data without any labels/ground-truth (thats why its under unsupervised branch) in the hopes that the trained model will capture the important co-relations between the inputted data dimensions. \n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of training such a network is to find the nonlinear relation among multiple dimensions of input dataset. Some of the applications of the autoencoders are dimentionality reduction, data compression, anomaly detection and many more. \n",
        "\n",
        "An autoencoders contains three parts/layers: \n",
        "\n",
        "1) An encoding layer called as 'Encoder'. \n",
        "\n",
        "2) A decoding layer called as 'Decoder'.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) A bottleneck-layer where your input data is transformed/reduced/compressed into a simpler representation. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "![Autoencoder](https://sci2lab.github.io/ml_tutorial/images/autoen_architecture.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Similar Techniques:**\n",
        "Similar to autoencoders, there are other dimentionality reduction algorithms/techniques such as [Principle Component Analysis (PCA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis#:~:text=Principal%20component%20analysis%20(PCA)%20is,components%20and%20ignoring%20the%20rest.). Major differences between PCA and autoencoders are that autoencoders able to capture the nonlinearity of the input data as opposed to PCA which works well with linear relationship mostly.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Why Autoencoders:**\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the reason to use autoencoders is to capture the latent space representation of a trained autoencoders and then use this representation for further training of different models such as a Convolutional Nueral Network (CNN) or a Fully Connected Network (FCN). \n",
        "\n",
        "The motivation is that if we train the CNN or FCN directly on our original datasets (normally in the form of images), these data images may contain noise and other useless information are we are not interested in training for in CNN and FCN. In contrast, using the latent space representation of our original image datasets to train a CNN or FCN may result in accuracy as well as it will train our CNN or FCN models faster. \n",
        "\n",
        "Of course there are many other reasons people use autoencoders. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Training Code:** \n",
        "\n",
        "In this workshop, We will use ```keras``` library to train an autoencoder model on the MNIST datasets. \n",
        "### **Task:**\n",
        "Your task will be to train a similar network on the breast phantom RGB images. The dataset for the RGB images are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sSwIe5eejJDgYfWnbR3Qry-3qiGrWDWF). You can download the ```rtp-rgbd``` dataset and only use color images from this dataset for the autoencoder training. \n",
