## Instructions

Please upload the ```autoencoder_mnist.ipynb``` file to your Google Drive underl `Colab-Notebook` folder. If you do not have this folder, please create one. 

Using Google-Colab is much simpler as we will not have to manually install Tensorflow, NumPy and other dependencies for this workshop. 

Thank you
